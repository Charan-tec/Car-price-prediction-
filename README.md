🚗 Car Price Prediction – Linear Regression

📖 Introduction


Buying or selling a used car often involves uncertainty about its fair market price. This project applies Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning technique, to predict the selling price of used cars based on multiple features. By analyzing historical car data, the model identifies patterns and provides data-driven predictions for future resale values.

🔎 Problem Statement

Car resale value depends on various factors such as year of manufacture, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and present price.

Manual estimation is often biased and inaccurate.

A predictive model can help sellers price cars competitively and buyers avoid overpaying.

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains historical records of used cars with features such as:

Feature	Description
Year	Year of manufacture
Present Price	Current ex-showroom price (in lakhs)
Kms Driven	Distance driven in kilometers
Fuel Type	Petrol / Diesel / CNG
Seller Type	Dealer / Individual
Transmission	Manual / Automatic
Owner	Number of previous owners
Selling Price	Price the car was sold for (Target Variable)
🛠 Tech Stack

Programming Language – Python 🐍

Libraries Used:

NumPy, Pandas – Data preprocessing & manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization & correlation analysis

Scikit-learn – Linear Regression, train-test split, evaluation metrics

Jupyter Notebook – Model development & analysis

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution analysis of numerical & categorical features

Correlation heatmap to identify feature-target relationships

Impact of fuel type, transmission, and seller type on price

Outlier detection for present price & kms driven

⚙️ Model Building

Data Preprocessing

Encoding categorical variables (Fuel Type, Transmission, Seller Type)

Splitting into training and testing sets

Model Training

Applied Linear Regression from Scikit-learn

Trained the model on 80% of data

Evaluation Metrics

R² Score – Measures goodness of fit

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

✅ Results

The model successfully predicts car prices based on key attributes.

Achieved strong R² score indicating good predictive power.

Provides interpretable results showing how each feature affects car value.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Implement advanced regression models: Ridge, Lasso, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost.

Deploy as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.

Add real-time APIs to fetch car price listings.

Incorporate feature engineering (car brand, location, depreciation rate).

📌 Use Cases

Car Dealers – Price cars competitively to attract buyers.

Individual Sellers – Get fair estimates before selling.

Buyers – Avoid overpaying by checking predicted resale value.

Financial Institutions – Assess car value for loans & insurance.
